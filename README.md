# Are-You-Dumb-
This playful "Are You Dumb?" game, built with Python's Tkinter library, asks users if they're dumb. Clicking "Yes" captures an image with the webcam, displays it, and shows a humorous message. If "No" is clicked, the button moves around the screen. The game is designed for fun and incorporates basic image processing with OpenCV.
